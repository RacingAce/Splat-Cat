# Splat-Cat

## See this link for the game on the online version of Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/511173286/

Click or tap your screen to jump! The longer you hold your mouse down before you release it, the further you will go. Try to land on as many platforms as possible, without running into the sides of them.
